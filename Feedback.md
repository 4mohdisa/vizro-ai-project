# 🔍 Feedback Breakdown

## 1. "HTML UI is okay but it's not properly connected with the backend"

**🟡 Analysis:** From your code, the UI uploads the CSV, sends it to `/generate` (via fetch), and expects a dashboard URL in return. But your backend script (`run_dashboard.py`) seems designed as a *CLI launcher*, not a web-serving API.

**✅ What needs improvement:**
- Convert the CLI logic into **an actual Flask/FastAPI endpoint** that dynamically runs Vizro from the uploaded file + config
- Return a proper **response with dashboard data or embed**, not just a redirect URL

## 2. "You are running a separate file to generate graphs and returning that — not the correct way"

**🟡 Analysis:** You're using `run_dashboard.py` to launch a separate process, which detaches the dashboard from the API. This makes:
- Logging/debugging harder
- Deployment less maintainable
- Live previews impossible without port conflicts

**✅ Fix suggestion:**
- Refactor `run_dashboard.py` into **functions** used directly by the backend (e.g., FastAPI route: `/generate` → runs `create_dashboard()` inline)
- Avoid using `sys.argv` and `os.system` for dashboard launches

## 3. "Use multithreading to generate the graph and show the frontend"

**🟢 Good idea IF:**
- You want to generate dashboards without blocking the main thread (especially for large files or multiple users)
- But consider using **async (FastAPI)** or **background task queues (Celery/RQ)** instead of raw multithreading if it grows

**✅ Example fix:** Use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to run dashboard generation without freezing UI.

## 4. "You don't need Flask. You can use uv to manage both frontend and backend natively in Python"

**🟢 Agreed — if you're using FastAPI or Starlette**.

`uvicorn` is the **ASGI server**, and using FastAPI (not Flask) would give:
- Async support
- Native HTML + API serving in one app
- Better performance
- Simplified deployment with just `uvicorn main:app --reload`

**✅ Recommendation:** Switch from Flask → FastAPI. Then:
- Serve the frontend (HTML + JS) via `StaticFiles`
- Handle `/generate` API via POST request
- Build dashboard inline and return URL/embed
